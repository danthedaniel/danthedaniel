Currently working as a Software Engineer for https://point.com

I'm experienced with Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. I long for a world of web
development where not every major framework is based on duck/weak typing. There
is a time and place for loose, typeless and interfaceless software design. I'm
not sure my production apps are that place.
